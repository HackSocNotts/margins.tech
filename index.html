      <p class="ma0 mb2">
        margins is a free one-day conference for people from marginalised backgrounds that work in/with/around technology (or hope to break into the industry!).</p>
      
      <p>Everyone is welcome to join us in Nottingham for a day filled with inspiration, solidarity and compassion.
      </p>

        <summary class="yellow">What does 
          “being marginalised” mean?</summary>
        That’s a really good question! “Being from a marginalised background” means that someone is part of a group that is being seen as “insignificant” or treated as “outside the norm” in society. This includes (but is not limited to) someone's gender identity, gender expression, sexuality, ethnicity, religion, class or ability.</details>
        
        
      <details class="ba bw1 b--peach pa2 mb3">
        <summary class="yellow">As an attendee, what can I expect?</summary>
        margins is a small, intimate conference for about 100 people. It will be a day filled with workshops and talks that are centred around technology, inspiration and solidarity.
        The conference is split into two tracks that run at the same time: One for workshops and one for talks. In between, around and outside these tracks, the space offers a chance to chat, network and meet new people on the day. Lunch and snacks will be provided for free. While the schedule is not finalised, margins will run from around 10am until 4pm-ish.
