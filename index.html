          margins is a free one-day conference for people from marginalised backgrounds that work in/with/around technology (or hope to break into the industry!).</p>

          <p>Everyone is welcome to join us in Nottingham for a day filled with inspiration, solidarity and compassion.

          <summary class="yellow z-1">What does “being marginalised” mean?</summary>
              That’s a really good question! “Being from a marginalised background” means that someone is part of a group that is being dismissed as “insignificant” or treated unfairly as “outside the norm” in society. This includes (but is not limited to) someone's gender identity, gender expression, sexuality, ethnicity, religion, class, dis/ability, physical appearanceo or body size. (Please talk to us to make this description better!)</details>


            <details class="ba bw1 b--peach pa2 mb3">
              <summary class="yellow">As an attendee, what can I expect?</summary>
              margins is a small, intimate conference for about 100 people. It will be a day filled with workshops and talks that are centred around technology, inspiration and solidarity.
              The conference is split into two tracks that run at the same time: One for workshops and one for talks. In between, around and outside these tracks, the space offers a chance to chat, network and meet new people on the day. Lunch and snacks will be provided for free. While the schedule is not finalised, margins will run from around 10am until 4pm-ish.
            </details>

          <details class="ba bw1 b--peach pa2 mb3">
              <summary class="yellow">Do I have to identify as “marginalised” to attend?</summary>
              The conference is open to everybody. If you're not from a marginalised background, if the term “marginalised” doesn't sit right with you, if you're not sure if you belong: Please come around! We would love to see on the day.

          <details class="ba bw1 b--peach pa2 mb3">
              <summary class="yellow">What about food & drinks?</summary>
            The event includes free lunch and snacks! We will have different free drinks on the day, but depending on the weather it might be a good idea to bring a drinking bottle (the university has free water fountains). We will cater for the widest range of dietary requirements possible (vegan, halal, kosher, gluten-free!), but <a href="mailto:velvet@margins.tech" class="link yellow hover-soft-purple">please get in touch</a> if you have specific needs!</details>

          <details class="ba bw1 b--peach pa2 mb3">
                      <summary class="yellow">Is there a Code of Conduct?</summary>
          Yeah! Everyone who attends will need to follow it. <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eDKZIR9pHJzX4Vee1AKrVKhzn0mAd_nowf3yu48mp1o" class="link yellow hover-soft-purple">You can read it here</a>.</details>

          <details class="ba bw1 b--peach pa2 mb3">
              <summary class="yellow">Could you tell me about the venue’s accessibility?</summary>
            Absolutely! The campus has several entrances and it itself is quite hilly and has several slopes. The most accessible route is to drive by car to Portland Building and park close to Trent Building’s parking lot. From there, it is 5mins on even ground to the venue. From the tram stop it is a ~10mins walk on uneven, slightly sloped ground.
  <br><br>
            The space in which the conference is being held (the Studio) is wheelchair accessible and on the ground floor. There are disabled toilets available around the space.  We will have gender-neutral toilets on the day. A calm, low stimulus room will be available in the building.

              Caring for one & all: a toolkit to help yourself & others recover from burnout or overwhelm
              <br><br>
- Slow down, get support & re-evaluate goals and priorities to replenish your energy<br>
- Learn & practise Liberating Structures to work through ways of recovering from burnout<br>
- Create together & take away resources<br>
<br><br>
Burnout is pretty common amongst marginalised people in tech. Sometimes it’s at a level that requires medical intervention. Sometimes it’s not and there are practical things you can do to recover and to help other people to recover. You can learn to recognise the warning signs to avoid burnout too.
<br><br>
As someone who’s been affected by burnout, depression & anxiety, and who cares about wellbeing and mental health, I love to do what I can to share what I’ve learned.
<br><br>
As a bonus, the practical activities we use in the workshop can be used in other ways to have better meetings & improve other interactions too. You can learn about <a href="https://brightlyk.com/2019/03/23/connecting-at-liberating-structures-global-gathering-2019-and-beyond/" class="link peach hover-soft-purple">Liberating Structures</a> in various places, but the best way is to experience them.

              <summary class="b">Diverse representations in design and awkward conversations with colleagues</summary>
              When working in design and user experience, people that need accessible and inclusive products of experiences often get referred to as ‘edge cases’ and subsequently pushed out of scope. It’s never easy to convince bosses or colleagues that aren’t themselves ‘edge cases ‘themselves to take the time and spend the resource caring for those that need more diverse design and representation in our visuals.<br><br>

Covering real-life past examples of frustrations from projects that didn’t go so well, ones that did go well and how I work as much diversity and inclusivity into my work as I can possibly get away with now with the hope to not only make it the standard approach from the companies and people that I work with, but also for the customers and end-users that are not marginalised, to consider that products, services and marketing should be representative for and of everyone, not just them.

              Can video games help with stressful situations through escapism? Yes, they can. The goal of this talk is to show how Bitsy can be used to create digital self-care spaces for escape, in case of struggling with anxiety, depression or simply to relax after a long day in a space of your own.
<br><br>
During the last year, I’ve been researching self-care in digital environments through different resources as well as my own games. At the same time, I noticed how important it is to establish in real life some kind of rituals for making our souls sparkle and our mental health healthy. But, what about digital spaces to help people achieve that? Can videogames be considered as digital spaces for escapism?
<br><br>
From these ideas, this talk was born, with the goal of helping others to build their own digital spaces with simple tools that also are used for making experimental games, and can introduce the attendees to the world of game design and development.
